# CBDjango - Django backend for Couchbase

This project aims to be a database backend for Django using Couchbase.

This does not require the django-nonrel fork, and is heavily inspired by the
[djangae](https://github.com/potatolondon/djangae) project.

Currently, this is very much a work in progress.

Installation/usage instructions will come along once this module stabilizes a
bit. Currently this is highly unstable and will still fail the vast majority
of Django's tests.
